    """
    Constructs a disrupted graph by selecting edges (and nodes if filter_nodes=True) that do not intersect with a given
    Multipolygon. Selected edges (and nodes) are added to a new graph which then gets returned by the function.
    Parameters
    ----------
    flooded_area: describes a flooded area
    street_network: street network consisting of nodes and edges in an undisrupted state
    keep_bridges: indicates whether bridges should be kept even though they are intersecting a flooded area
    filter_nodes: indicates whether nodes within the flooded area should be added to the disrupted graph

    Returns
    -------
    Disrupted graph based on the flooded area and the initial street network
